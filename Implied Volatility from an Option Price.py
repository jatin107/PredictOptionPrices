#The Black-Scholes model tells us what an option should be worth given its strike price, the risk-free interest rate, the remaining time until expiration, the stock's price, and the implied volatility.
# For example, the price of a call,C is given by,

#S is the price of the stock,
#K is the strike price,
#r is the annualized risk-free rate, and
#t is the remaining time to expiration expressed in years.
#Î¦ is the normal cumulative distribution function, and
